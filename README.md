### Simple Flask Template

This is a Flask app built off the [standard bootstrap template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) that includes additional examples of how to link to subpages, tables, and model returns. 

This was tested with an Anaconda distribution of python with the package versions listed in ``requirements.txt`` on a Mac. You don't need all those packages for this to work - all you should need is a python distribution (e.g. Anaconda) and install flask (e.g. ``conda install flask`` from the terminal). 

Then navigate to the directory you downloaded this repository to and launch ``run.py`` from your virtual environment. Then if everything worked you should be able to go to ``http://localhost:5000/`` and see your web app!
